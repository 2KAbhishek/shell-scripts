<h3>Utilities on the shell üêöüî¶</h3>

</div>

## What is this

A collection of shell scripts for various utilities.

## Inspiration

Needed a place to store all the scripts I write.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `bash`

## Getting shell-scripts

To get shell-scripts, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/shell-scripts
cd shell-scripts/scripts
```

## Using shell-scripts

All scripts are placed under the `scripts` directory, feel free to edit them or use them as reference.

## How it was built

shell-scripts was built using `neovim`

## What I learned

- The quirks and gotchas of bash syntax, the most common one: avoid spaces in assignments `var=1`.

## What's next

Will be adding more scripts.
